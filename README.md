# my_radar

Compilation via Makefile,including re, clean and fclean rules.

2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic, written in Modular C.
Parses the airplane and towers info from the entities.txt.

The basic rules for the my_radar are as follows:
• aircrafts fly from given places to other ones.
• aircrafts appear on the simulation panel when they take off.
• aircrafts disappear from the simulation panel when they land on.
• aircrafts move in a straight line at given constant speeds.
• aircrafts colliding with another one is destroyed and disappear from the simulation panel.
• control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed and they can continue
on their way.
• control towers don’t move and have control areas on the map.
• control towers appear on the simulation panel at launch.
